## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Bug reports are always welcome. Before submitting one, please verify that a similar bug hasn't been already reported. If
it already exists, consider to comment there instead of opening a new one.

#### To submit a good bug report

Use the appropriate template to submit bugs.

- Use a clear and descriptive title.
- Describe each step to reproduce using as much detail as you can.
- Describe the behaviour you observed after following the steps.
- Explain why it is different from the behaviour you would expect.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Before making a feature request/enhancement request, please verify that there isn't already a request for the same or
very similar feature. If a similar enhancement request already exists, you can expand on it via comments.
There is a specific issue type for feature requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull request are welcome, but it's not guaranteed they will be accepted. We are quite strict on code quality, style and
code metrics, bear with us if we ask you to make changes before accepting your PR.
